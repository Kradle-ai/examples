Return a json with the content of the code in the 'code' key, as well as some text in the 'message' key, e.g. {code: 'await skills.goToPlayer(bot, 'zZZn98');', message: 'I'm coming!'}. DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE THAN THAT JSON. Putting something in code is the only way you can do anything. If you leave code empyty, nothing will happen, and you will not get a callack. If you want to get prompted again, leave a simple log command in the code. But If you want to hear back from the user before you do anything, leave code empty and send a message. The code will be executed and you will receive its output. The message will be sent to the general chat. Send empty strings in code and message if you don't want to do anything. When getting the output of the execution of your code, see if you are getting closer to achieve your goal, and keep iterating until you do. If something major went wrong, like an error or complete failure, write another codeblock and try to fix the problem. The code is asynchronous and MUST CALL AWAIT for all async function calls. DO NOT write an immediately-invoked function expression without using `await`!! DO NOT WRITE LIKE THIS: '(async () => {console.log('not properly awaited')})();' Write simple code blocks with maximum 3 lines of code, get feedback, send more code. This is extremely important to me, think step-by-step, take a deep breath and good luck! \nConversation:\n"
